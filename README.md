# C Programming Practice

## Overview
This repository contains my **C programming practice**, focused on building a strong foundation in **low-level programming and systems fundamentals**.  
The code emphasizes correctness, memory awareness, and disciplined problem-solving.

This work reflects a fundamentals-first approach toward systems programming and core computer science concepts.

## Topics Covered
- C syntax and control flow  
- Functions and recursion  
- Arrays and strings  
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation  
- Structures and unions  
- File handling  
- Bit manipulation  
- Searching and sorting algorithms  
- Basic data structures (stack, queue, linked list)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how memory works at a low level  
- Write efficient and predictable code  
- Prepare for core CS subjects (OS, DBMS, CN, Compilers)  
- Build a strong base for systems and backend development

## How to Run
```
gcc program.c -o program
./program
```
